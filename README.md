# Chess database frontend

This is the code for the front-end of the chess database. The front-end app is built in React.

The main features of the app are as follows:
- First, you pick a database
- For the database, you can see either a list of games or game statistics
- You can click on each game to get a board and walk through the moves
- The statistics are one of the main features. Right now, we are providing the following:
  - For each player, what's the average centipawn loss for their games?
  - For each player, what is the average evaluation of their positions by move number?
- Within a database, you can filter games by tournament

# Next steps

- Design improvements
- Additional statistics
- Provide a production site
